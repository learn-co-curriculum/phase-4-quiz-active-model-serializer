# Active Model Serializer

Consider an app with `Chef`, `Recipe` and `Review` resources, where chefs have many
recipes and recipes have many reviews.

When a user makes a `GET` request to `/chefs/:id`, you want to send a JSON
response that includes a list of the chef's recipes and a list of each recipe's
reviews as follows:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Mary Berry",
  "recipes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Classic Lemon Tart",
      "reviews": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "score": 10,
          "comment": "Worthy of a handshake!"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Select the serializer(s) that you would need to write to produce the desired
JSON response. Select all that apply:

## Correct

```rb
class ChefSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name
  has_many :recipes
end
```

> Spot on! Since we want the **chef** to include a nested array of **recipes**,
> we need to include `has_many :recipes` in the `ChefSerializer`.

## Correct

```rb
class RecipeSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name
  has_many :reviews
end
```

> Right! Since we want each **recipe** to include a nested array of **reviews**,
> we need to include `has_many :reviews` in the `RecipeSerializer`.

## Incorrect

```rb
class ChefSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name
  has_many :recipes
  has_many :reviews, through: :recipes
end
```

> Since we want the reviews nested under each recipe in our JSON, we only need
> to include `has_many :reviews` in the `RecipeSerializer`, not in the
> `ChefSerializer`.
