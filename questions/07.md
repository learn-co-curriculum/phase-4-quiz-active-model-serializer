# Active Model Serializer

1. Consider an app with Author and Book resources, where authors have many books and books belong to an author. You want to create two Book serializers: one to display details about books in the Book routes, and a second to use for the Author `show` route (AuthorBookSerializer) that displays just the title and publication date for each of the author’s books. Which of the following do you need to do:

Use the `include` option in the Author controller. ()

## Correct

Explicitly pass the AuthorBookSerializer in the Author serializer.

## Incorrect

Explicitly pass the AuthorBookSerializer in the Author controller.

## Incorrect

Include the `belongs_to :author` association method in the Book serializer.

> This is a tricky one! It is not necessary to complete the association in both
> directions to show the list of books in our Author routes. You should only do
> this if you want the associated author to be included in the json for books.

## Incorrect

Use the `include` option in the Author controller.

> The `include` option is only necessary if you want to render data that’s nested
> more than one level deep.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
