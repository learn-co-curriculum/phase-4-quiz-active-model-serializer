# Active Model Serializer

Your app includes a User model with `first_name`, `last_name`, and `title`
("Ms.", "Mx.", etc.) attributes. You want to be able to include an honorific in
the JSON response for your User model (for example, "Dr. Valdez"). What code
could you write in the `UserSerializer` class to accomplish this?

## Correct

```rb
# user_serializer.rb
class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  def honorific
    "#{self.object.title} #{self.object.last_name}"
  end
end
```

> Right! In instance methods defined in the the `UserSerializer` class, `self`
> refers to the `UserSerializer` instance, and `self.object` refers to the
> object being serialized (the `User` instance).

## Incorrect

```rb
# user_serializer.rb
class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  def honorific
    "#{self.title} #{self.last_name}"
  end
end
```

> Not quite. In instance methods defined in the the `UserSerializer` class,
> `self` refers to the `UserSerializer` instance, not the `User` instance, so we
> can't access the user's the `title` and `last_name` attributes directly.

## Incorrect

```rb
# user_serializer.rb
class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  def honorific
    "#{title} #{last_name}"
  end
end
```

> Not quite. The `title` and `last_name` methods are defined in the `User`
> class, not the `UserSerializer` class, so we can't use them directly.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
