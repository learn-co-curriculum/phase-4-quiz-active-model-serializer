# Active Model Serializer

Your app includes a User model with `first_name`, `last_name`, and `title`
(“Ms.”, “Mx.”, etc.) attributes. You want the json for your User routes to
include an honorific (for example, “Dr. Valdez”). Fill in the blanks in the
custom method below to implement this:

```
#user_serializer.rb
def honorific
  "#{[title]} #{[lastname]}"
end
```

&nbsp;

## Correct

- self.object.title
- title

## Correct

- self.object.last\_name
- lastname
