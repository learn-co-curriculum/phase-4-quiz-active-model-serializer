# Active Model Serializer

Consider an app with `Author` and `Book` resources, where `Author`s have many `Book`s
and `Book`s belong to an `Author`.

When a user makes a `GET` request to `/authors/:id`, you want to use a custom
serializer, the `CustomBookSerializer`, instead of the default `BookSerializer`,
for generating the JSON for each book associated with the author:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Mary Berry",
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "Recipe for Life"
    }
  ]
}
```

Which of the following code snippets uses the `CustomBookSerializer` correctly?

## Correct

```rb
# app/serializers/custom_book_serializer.rb
class CustomBookSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :title
end

# app/serializers/author_serializer.rb
class AuthorSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name

  has_many :books, serializer: CustomBookSerializer
end

# app/controllers/authors_controller.rb
class AuthorsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    author = Author.find(params[:id])
    render json: author
  end
end
```

> Right! The `has_many` macro typically uses naming conventions to serialize an
> associated resource, but we can **explicitly** tell it to use a different
> serializer with the `serializer` option.

## Incorrect

```rb
# app/serializers/custom_book_serializer.rb
class CustomBookSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :title
end

# app/serializers/author_serializer.rb
class AuthorSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name

  has_many :books
end

# app/controllers/authors_controller.rb
class AuthorsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    author = Author.find(params[:id])
    render json: author, serializer: CustomBookSerializer
  end
end
```

> Not quite. When using the `serializer` option along with the `render` method,
> we'd be using the `CustomBookSerializer` to serialize the `author` object
> instead of the books associated with the author.

## Incorrect

```rb
# app/serializers/custom_book_serializer.rb
class CustomBookSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :title
end

# app/serializers/author_serializer.rb
class AuthorSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name

  has_many :books
end

# app/controllers/authors_controller.rb
class AuthorsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    author = Author.find(params[:id])
    render json: author, include: ['custom_books']
  end
end
```

> The `include` option is only necessary if you want to render data that’s nested
> more than one level deep — it doesn't help here with our custom serializer.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
