# Active Model Serializer

Consider an app with Chef, Recipe and Review resources, where chefs have many
recipes and recipes have many reviews. In the Chef show route, you want the json
to include a list of the chef’s recipes and a list of each recipe’s reviews. To
produce the desired json for this route, you need to: (select all that apply)

## Correct

Include `has_many :recipes` in the Chef serializer

## Correct

Include `has_many :reviews` in the Recipe serializer

## Incorrect

Include `has_many :reviews` in the Chef serializer

> You should only include the `has_many` association method in the serializer that
> you want the reviews to be directly nested under in your json
