# Active Model Serializer

Which of the following are true of the `ActiveModel::Serializer` gem? Select all
that apply.

## Correct

It follows **convention over configuration**

> Correct! With the `ActiveModel::Serializer` gem installed, we can easily
> serialize our Active Record objects by creating a new class that inherits from
> `ActiveModel::Serializer` and follows the appropriate naming conventions.

## Correct

It helps with **separation of concerns**

> Right! In a Rails application, separation of concerns is important since Rails
> follows the Model-View-Controller pattern. `ActiveModel::Serializer` helps
> when creating classes that are responsible for converting an Active Record
> object into a JSON string, acting like the view layer in our application.

## Incorrect

It comes **built in** with Rails

> Rails has some of its own serialization methods built in, but
> `ActiveModel::Serializer` is a separate gem that we need to add to our
> projects.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
